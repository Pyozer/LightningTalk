# Denial Of Service (DoS)

---

## What is DoS ?

---

DoS is an attack to make a machine or network resource unavailable by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services of a host connected to the Internet.

---

DoS is accomplished by flooding the targeted machine with superfluous requests, in order to overload systems.

---

Servers are able to handle many requests with high availability.

DDoS is a Distributed Denial Of Service. The goal is to infect many zombie machines and launch a DoS attack on these machines.

---

A DoS attack can be limited by identifying the IP address and blocking requests at the firewall.

In case of a DDoS attack is more difficult to identify these IPs due to many machines.

---

Some tools has been developped to do this, like :

- Trinoo <sub><sup>(UDP flooding)</sup></sub>
- Tribe Flood Network <sub><sup>(UDP/TCP/TCP SYN flooding, Smurf)</sup></sub>
- Schaft <sub><sup>(UDP/TCP/ICMP flooding)</sup></sub>
- LOIC <sub><sup>(TCP/UDP/HTTP)</sup></sub>
- HOIC <sub><sup>(TCP/UDP/HTTP)</sup></sub>
- WebLoic <sub><sup>(LOIC for Android)</sup></sub>

## Type of attack

---

### Exploitation of faults or machine limitations

Send an ICMP packet of more than 65,535 bytes, which resulted in UDP fragmentation errors, or TCP packets containing illegal/incompatible flags.

---

### SYN Flood denial of service attack

When a client wants to connect to a server, it sends a SYN message to the server.

```
      Normal                     SYN Flood

Client      Serveur         Client      Serveur
------      -------         ------      -------
 SYN  ---->                   SYN  ----> 
      <---- SYN-ACK                <---- SYN-ACK
 ACK  ---->                 No response
```
---

### UDP Flooding

Send many UDP packet (UDP traffic priority over TCP).

Result in a saturation of the bandwidth leaving very little TCP traffic.

---

### Packet Fragment

Use weaknesses of some TCP / IP stacks in IP defragmentation.<br />
The second fragment is contained in the first (overlapping).

Some systems do not handle this exception, result in a crash.

---

### Smurfing

When a broadcast ping (ICMP protocol) is sent, it's to each machine of the network.
The source IP is changed by the IP of the target and a continuous stream of ping is sent. All machines responds to the target.

The huge traffic generated causes network saturation.

## October 21, 2002

The full DNS root was attacked for one hour.<br />
7 of 13 (A to M) servers saw their performance degraded due to a flow of around 150K requests per second to each of the servers.

But that did not cause a big pertubartion.

---

## February 7, 2007

Another DNS root was attacked for 24h.

4 (F, G, L and M) servers out of 13 were targeted. F and M were seriously affected while G and L reported an unusual charge.
Anycast enable to limited the DoS attack, introduced following the first attack.

---

## November 30, 2015,<br />December 1st, 2015

The 13 root servers were the subject of 2 DDoS attacks, causing delays on the root servers B, C, G and H.
About 5 million queries were sent per second.
3 of the 13 root servers experienced slowdowns, but the impact was limited.

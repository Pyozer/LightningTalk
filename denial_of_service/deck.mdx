# Denial Of Service (DoS)

---

## What is DoS ?

---

DoS is an attack to make a machine or network resource unavailable by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services of a host connected to the Internet.

---

DoS is accomplished by flooding the targeted machine with superfluous requests, in order to overload systems.

---

In recent years, servers have been able to handle many requests with high availability.
DDoS is a Distributed Denial Of Service. The goal is to infect many zombie machines and launch a denial of service attack on these machines.

---

A DoS attack can be limited by identifying the IP address and blocking requests at the firewall.
In the case of a DDoS attack, it is more difficult to identify these IPs due to many machines.

---

Some tools has been developped to do this, like :

- Trinoo <sub><sup>(UDP flooding)</sup></sub>
- Tribe Flood Network <sub><sup>(UDP/TCP/TCP SYN flooding, Smurf)</sup></sub>
- Schaft <sub><sup>(UDP/TCP/ICMP flooding)</sup></sub>
- LOIC <sub><sup>(TCP/UDP/HTTP)</sup></sub>
- HOIC <sub><sup>(TCP/UDP/HTTP)</sup></sub>
- WebLoic <sub><sup>(LOIC pour Android)</sup></sub>

**October 21, 2002**

The full DNS root was attacked for one hour.<br />
7 of 13 (A to M) servers saw their performance degraded due to a flow of around 150K requests per second to each of the servers.

But that did not cause a big pertubartion.

**February 7, 2007**

Another DNS root was attacked for 24h.

4 (F, G, L and M) servers out of 13 were targeted. F and M were seriously affected while G and L reported an unusual charge.
Anycast enable to limited the DoS attack, introduced following the first attack.

**November 30, 2015** and **December 1st, 2015**

The 13 root servers were the subject of 2 DDoS attacks, causing delays on the root servers B, C, G and H.
About 5 million queries were sent per second.
3 of the 13 root servers experienced slowdowns, but the impact was limited.
